Find a chain of words starting with one word and ending with another. Successive entries in the chain must all be real words, and each can differ from the previous word by just one letter. For example, you can get from "cat" to "dog" using the following chain.

````
cat
cot
cog
dog
````

You can turn lead into gold with the following chain:

````

load
goad
gold
````
